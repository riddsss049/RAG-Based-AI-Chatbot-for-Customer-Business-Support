# 🏊‍♂️ JMD Pools RAG-Based AI Chatbot
# 📌 Overview

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based AI chatbot built for JMD Pools, a swimming pool construction and services company.
It provides accurate, context-aware answers by retrieving information from internal documents and generating responses using an LLM.

The chatbot reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in company-specific data, making it suitable for real-world business use.
